    <h1>Aims</h1>
    <p>Being organized brings the value of productiveness to life. To stay organized some planning should be done
        beforehand. As for me I like an idea of putting stickers on dashboard. You can write whatever you want and just
        delete it when it is completed.</p>
    <p>But you canâ€™t take sticker notes with you easily, you must take pictures. So, I tried to make a small website for
        creating stickers on board with syncing, so you can easily see your dashboard wherever you are. </p>
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <p>If you have any issues or tips you can create a ticket at GitHub page <a
            href="https://github.com/drweb86/dashboard">https://github.com/drweb86/dashboard</a>.</p>
    <h1>Art-Works</h1>
    <p>The project would not be possible without using next art-works as background images:</p>
    <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let artWork of backgroundPictures">
            <a href="{{artWork.taken_from}}"><i>{{artWork.file}}</i></a> by <a
                href="{{artWork.author_web_site ? artWork.author_web_site : artWork.author_profile}}">{{artWork.author}}</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
